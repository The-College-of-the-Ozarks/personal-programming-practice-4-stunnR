# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 4

---

Write programs to tackle the following problems. Use the specified .py file (in **bold**) for each part (each file should be created automatically in your repository). You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

1. In **logs.py**, I have written code that takes an input, and plugs it into the function $$g(x) = \ln(100 - x^2) + \sqrt{84 - 5x - x^2}.$$ This function only allows inputs inside the interval $(-10, 7]$ (that is, $-10 < x \leq 7$). Adjust the input statement to prompt the user for valid input, and use a conditional to ensure the function is only evaluated if the input is within the allowed interval. If they input an invalid number, output an error message and stop the program.
2. In **convert.py**, the user will input a speed (in mph) and you will present them with a menu. The user will then choose if they wish to output their speed in kph, ft/s, or m/s. The conversion functions are defined, you need to construct a visually pleasing menu, and call each function in the appropriate place.
